## AUTOMOTIVE DIAGNOSTICS

This project involves the analysis of a dataset comprising Engine Coolant Temperature, Engine RPM, Vehicle Speed Sensor, etc.

The aim is to identify patterns and factors of interest in order to provide meaningful insights.

The following problems are investigated:
* Predicting vehicle states
* Analysing driving behaviour
* 

## Objectives:



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from https://radar.kit.edu/radar/en/dataset/bCtGxdTklQlfQcAq#
The dataset comprises CSV files containing ten vehicle signals logged via the OBD-II interface: Engine coolant temperature, intake manifold absolute pressure, enginer RPM, vehicle speed sensor, intake air temperature, air flow rate from mass flow sensor, absolute throttle position, ambient air temperature as well as the accelerator pedal positions D and E. The data was recorded with the OBD-II dongle KIWI 3 from PLX Devices in combination with the smartphone application OBD Auto Doctor from Creosys on an iOS device.
