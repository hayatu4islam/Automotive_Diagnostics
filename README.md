## AUTOMOTIVE DIAGNOSTICS

This project involves the analysis of a dataset comprising Engine Coolant Temperature, Engine RPM, Vehicle Speed Sensor, etc.

The aim is to identify patterns and factors of interest in order to provide meaningful insights.

The following problems are investigated:
* Predicting vehicle states
    * Engine overheating - Look for patterns in engine coolant temperature and intake air temperature to identify instances of overheating.
    * Engine (poor) performance - Examine relationships between engine RPM, airflow rate, and vehicle speed to identify any patterns indicating poor engine performance. Find maximum fuel economy versus speed.
    * Full efficiency - Explore how the absolute throttle position and accelerator pedal positions correlate with the vehicle speed and airflow rate to assess fuel efficiency.
    * Throttle response - Analyse the data to understand how accelerator pedal positions D and E influence the engine RPM and vehicle speed, addressing potential throttle response problems.
* Analysing driving behaviour
    * hddh
    * 
* Visualising the speed and elevation on a map (From YT)


## Objectives:



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from https://radar.kit.edu/radar/en/dataset/bCtGxdTklQlfQcAq#
The dataset comprises CSV files containing ten vehicle signals logged via the OBD-II interface: Engine coolant temperature, intake manifold absolute pressure, enginer RPM, vehicle speed sensor, intake air temperature, air flow rate from mass flow sensor, absolute throttle position, ambient air temperature as well as the accelerator pedal positions D and E. The data was recorded with the OBD-II dongle KIWI 3 from PLX Devices in combination with the smartphone application OBD Auto Doctor from Creosys on an iOS device.
